      ## About this application

      ![Airtng](//howtodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/airtng-screen.png)

      This [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) sample application is
      modeled after the amazing rental experience created by
      [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com), but with more 
      [Klingons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon). 

      Host users can offer rental properties which other guest users can reserve. 
      The guest and the host can then anonymously communicate via a disposable Twilio phone number created 
      just for a reservation. In this tutorial, we'll show you the key bits of
      code to make this work. 

      To run this sample app yourself, 
      [download the code and follow the instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/anonymous-communications-rails).

      ## Create a reservation

      The first step in connecting a guest and host is creating a reservation.
      Here, we handle a form submission for a new reservation which contains the
      guest's name and phone number.

      ## Confirm the reservation

      Before the reservation is finalized, the host needs to confirm that the property
      is still available. Learn how to automate this process in [our first AirTNG
      tutorial, Workflow Automation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/howto/walkthrough/workflow-automation/ruby/rails).

      Once the reservation is confirmed, we need to create a Twilio number that
      the guest and host can use to communicate in the `provision_phone_number` method.

  .step(data-file='app/models/reservation.rb', data-highlight='61-85')
    :markdown
      ## Create a phone number for the guest and host to use

      Here we use a [Twilio REST API Client](//twilio-ruby.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html#getting-started)
      to search for and buy a new phone number to associate with the reservation.
      When we buy the number, we designate a [Twilio application](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/applications)
      that will handle [webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) requests
      when the new number receives an incoming call or text.

      We then save the new phone number on our `Reservation` model, so when our app
      receives calls or texts to this number, we'll know which reservation the call or
      text belongs to.

      ## Find a reservation when a guest or host calls

      In our controller, we create a filter which gets executed every time Twilio
      asks our application how to handle an incoming call or text.  This filter
      finds and stores the correct reservation (the one associated with the anonymous number)
      as an instance variable that will be used as we connect the guest and host via
      voice or SMS.

      ## Connect guest and host via SMS

      Our [Twilio application](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/applications)
      should be configured to [send HTTP requests](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/twilio_request) 
      to this controller method on any incoming text message. Our app responds with 
      [TwiML](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml) to tell Twilio what to do in
      response to the message.

      If the initial message sent to the anonymous number was sent by the host, 
      we forward it on to the guest. We forward it
      to the host if the original message was sent by the guest.

      ## Connect guest and host via phone call

      Our [Twilio application](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/applications)
      will [send HTTP requests](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/twilio_request) 
      to this method on any incoming voice call. Our app responds with 
      [TwiML instructions](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml)
      that tell Twilio to `Play` an introductory MP3 audio file and then
      `Dial` either the guest or host, depending on who initiated the call.
